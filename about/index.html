            <p>
              I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my
              small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree
              in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online,
              I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there.
              I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site
              to fit my own specific needs.

            <p>
              That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut.
              When I learned how to build my first website,
              I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &
              versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made
              a full switch to front-end development, where
              I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write
              clean, elegant code.
